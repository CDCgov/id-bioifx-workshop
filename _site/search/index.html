We would like our team and communities (both government and private sector) to reflect on diversity of all kinds, not just the classes protected in law. Diversity fosters innovation. Diverse teams are creative teams. We need a diversity of perspective to create solutions for the challenges we face. This is our code of conduct (adapted from [18F's Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct)). We follow all Equal Employment Opportunity laws and we expect everyone we work with to adhere to the [GSA Anti-harassment Policy](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/directive/d0/content/512516), even if they do not work for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or GSA. We expect every user to follow this code of conduct and the laws and policies mentioned above. ## Be Empowering Consider what you can do to encourage and support others. Make room for quieter voices to contribute. Offer support and enthusiasm for great ideas. Leverage the low cost of experimentation to support your colleagues' ideas, and take care to acknowledge the original source. Look for ways to contribute and collaborate, even in situations where you normally wouldn't. Share your knowledge and skills. Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process. ## Rules of Behavior * I understand that I must complete security awareness and records management training annually in order to comply with the latest security and records management policies. * I understand that I must also follow the [Rules of Behavior for use of HHS Information Resources](http://www.hhs.gov/ocio/policy/hhs-rob.html) * I understand that I must not use, share, or store any kind of sensitive data (health status, provision or payment of healthcare, PII, etc.) under ANY circumstance. * I will not knowingly conceal, falsify, or remove information. * I understand that I can only use non-sensitive and/or publicly available data. * I understand that all passwords I create to set up accounts need to comply with CDC's password policy. * I understand that the stewards reserves the right to moderate all data at any time. ## Boundaries Create boundaries to your own behavior and consider how you can create a safe space that helps prevent unacceptable behavior by others. We can't list all instances of unacceptable behavior, but we can provide examples to help guide our community in thinking through how to respond when we experience these types of behavior, whether directed at ourselves or others. If you are unsure if something is appropriate behavior, it probably is not. Each person we interact with can define where the line is for them. Impact matters more than intent. Ensuring that your behavior does not have a negative impact is your responsibility. Problems usually arise when we assume that our way of thinking or behavior is the norm for everyone. ### Here are some examples of unacceptable behavior * Negative or offensive remarks based on the protected classes as listed in the GSA Anti-harassment Policy of race, religion, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetric information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, maritual status, and political affiliation as well as gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or backgrounds, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, or clothing. Consider that calling attention to differences can feel alienating. * Sustained disruption of meetings, talks, or discussions, including chatrooms. * Patronizing language or behavior. * Aggressive behavior, such as unconstructive criticism, providing correction that do not improve the conversation (sometimes referred to as \"well actually's\"), repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else, feigning surprise at someone's lack of knowledge or awareness about a topic, or subtle prejudice. * Referring to people in a way that misidentifies their gender and/or rejects the validity of their gender identity; for instance by using incorrect pronouns or forms of address (misgendering). * Retaliating against anyone who files a formal complaint that someone has violated these codes or laws. ## Background CDC Scientific Clearance is the process of obtaining approvals by appropriate CDC officials before a CDC information product is released to the public or CDC's external public health partners. Information products that require formal clearance include print, electronic, or oral materials, that CDC employees author or co-author, whether published by CDC or outside CDC. CDC contractors developing content on behalf of CDC for the public or CDC's external public health partners are also required to put their content through the formal clearance process. The collaborative functions related to the projects include blogs, wikis, forums, bug tracking sites, source control and others deemed as necessary. For those individuals within the CDC, adherence to the following policies are required: * CDC [\"Clearance of Information Products Disseminated Outside CDC for Public Use\"](http://www.cdc.gov/maso/Policy/PublicUse.pdf) * HHS [\"Ensuring the Quality of Information Disseminated by HHS agencies\"](http://aspe.hhs.gov/infoquality) All collaborative materials will be controlled by the rules contained within this document. This will allow for the real-time collaboration opportunities among CDC employees, CDC contractors and CDC public health partners. ## Credit This code of conduct was mainly adapted from [18F's Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct) and the [CDC's Informatics Innovation Unit R&D Lab's code of conduct.](https://www.philab.cdc.gov/index.php/code-of-conduct/) ## Relevant Legal Considerations * [Laws enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission](http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/index.cfm) * [Types of discrimination prohibited by law](http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types) * [New and proposed regulations](http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/regulations/index.cfm)" },{"title": "CDC GitHub Practices for Open Source Projects", "url": "/open_practices/", "content": "# CDC GitHub Practices for Open Source Projects **The [CDCGov organization on GitHub](https://github.com/CDCgov) is designated for use by CDC programs to publish open source code.** This is a set of practices to help programs release secure and compliant open source projects successfully. If you are interested in using GitHub for non-open source projects, please see information on our [enterprise organization](#cdc-enterprise). We designed these practices to be straightforward and helpful, and we [accept feedback](#support-and-feedback) from the community on updating them. For [Required Practices](#required-practices), Projects that don't adhere to the [Required Practices](#required-practices) could be subject to [archival or removal](#non-compliance-procedure). ## Getting Started Before you can publish your project, you must request access to be added to the CDCgov organization. Complete these steps: 1. Review the [Rules of Behavior](/rules_of_behavior/). 2. Confirm your [Github profile is setup](#profile-setup) properly. 3. Complete the [project request form]([https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=aQjnnNtg_USr6NJ2cHf8j44WSiOI6uNOvdWse4I-C2NUNk43NzMwODJTRzA4NFpCUk1RRU83RTFNVi4u](https://servicedesk.cdc.gov/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=ca066a881b11f8102954873fe54bcb4a)). * This will require your CDC login, so if you don't have a login, ask someone to request on your behalf, or [get in touch](#support-and-feedback). You should receive an email or notification when you are given access and your first repository should be setup for you. For subsequent projects, you will be able to create a repository in the organization using Github's interface. The [template repository](https://github.com/CDCgov/template) is maintained and an easy way to quick start your repository that complies with the guidelines. Once this is completed you're ready to follow the required guidelines to publish code. ## Required Practices You must follow these practices before you publish real code into your repository. * [ ] **Get Clearance.** Always obtain clearance from your organization prior to setting up and publishing a repository. * GitHub is a third party service used by CDC to collaborate with the public. Official CDC health messages will always be distributed through www.cdc.gov and through appropriate channels, so make sure to plan your project along with your official public health program on cdc.gov. * [ ] **Naming.** Set a meaningful project name and short description for your project. The form to do this is in your repositories settings. * [ ] Add [topics](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) to improve discovery and use of your project. For AI-related projects, the [Code.gov Implementation Guidance to Federal Agencies Regarding Enterprise Data and Source Code Inventories](https://code.gov/federal-agencies/compliance/inventory-code) must be followed when setting topics. * [ ] **Create a README.** Add a `README.md` file at the root with the following: * An overview of your project, including the purpose, goals and the team responsible. * A description of your development process in the `README.md` file. If your project is no longer active, mark it as [archived](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/archiving-repositories). * Include the following notice sections. You can modify the verbiage and adapt as necessary based on your program need. * [ ] [Public Domain Standard Notice](https://github.com/CDCgov/template#public-domain-standard-notice) * [ ] [License Standard Notice](https://github.com/CDCgov/template#license-standard-notice) * [ ] [Privacy Standard Notice](https://github.com/CDCgov/template#privacy-standard-notice) * [ ] [Contributing Standard Notice](https://github.com/CDCgov/template#contributing-standard-notice) * [ ] [Records Management Standard Notice](https://github.com/CDCgov/template#records-management-standard-notice) * [ ] [Additional Standard Notices](https://github.com/CDCgov/template#additional-standard-notices) * [ ] **Choose a license.** Assign an open source license based on program need. * If you need help choosing a license, please review [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20250306075939/https://www.techlab.cdc.gov/index.php/2012/03/27/open-source-development-for-public-health-informatics-historical-archive/), refer to existing CDCgov projects, or ask for consultation support in choosing a license. * [ ] **Security scanning and review.** * **This is the final step before publishing and the most critical.** * All source code used within CDC systems must comply with all cybersecurity processes prior to production use, including static and dynamic scanning. The same applies to code published as open source. * If you are unsure about compliance, reach out to your organization's security officers. * Never commit sensitive information, including usernames, passwords, tokens, PII, PHI. To automate this, you can integrate pre-commit tools like [Clouseau](https://github.com/cfpb/clouseau) to systematically review material before committing. * Make sure that the commit history of your Github repository also doesn't have these things. In many cases it's easier to start a new repository and push up the code that has all sensitive information removed as the first commit. * Enable [GitHub automated security alerts](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-security-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies) and configure notification for the repo admin to see. * [ ] **Setup your profile.** [Active project committers need to add profile info to help collaboration.](#profile-setup) * [ ] **Two-factor authentication (2FA).** [Project admins must secure their account with two-factor-authentication.](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.21/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa) * [ ] **Maintain your repository.** Once your repository is published, you must do the following to remain in compliance: * [ ] **Respond to critical security issues and communication from administrators.** Ignoring security issues or not responding to communication from administrators can result in [archiving or removal](#non-compliance-procedure). * [ ] **Archive old projects.** If you're no longer updating the project or have moved it's location, update your `README.md` file to let users know and [archive the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/archiving-repositories). ## Recommended Practices Optional improvements to make your open source project more successful. * [ ] Establish pull request templates to make it easier for contributors to send pull requests. For example [SDP-V has a checklist for each PR to match their development practices.](https://github.com/CDCgov/SDP-Vocabulary-Service/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE) * [ ] Agree on project conventions and include them in your `README.md` file. Depending on what type of project, this includes folder structure for data, linters, editor configuration (eg, [MicrobeTrace's .editorconfig](https://github.com/CDCgov/MicrobeTrace/blob/master/.editorconfig)). This will help improve the quality of your project and make it easier for others to contribute to your project. * [ ] Add support and community procedures. CDC does not provide warranty or official support for open source projects, but describing how you would like questions and issues will assist users of your project. If you use a wiki, or project board, or package manager, describe and link to that. Official contribution steps will make it easier for people outside of CDC to contribute to your project. * [ ] Include references to publications, presentations, and sites featuring your project. * [ ] Add an entry to [open.cdc.gov](https://open.cdc.gov) to the [data](https://open.cdc.gov/data.html), [code](https://open.cdc.gov/code.html), [api](https://open.cdc.gov/apis.html), or [event](https://open.cdc.gov/events.html) page to help people find your project on cdc.gov * [ ] Add versions and tags describing major releases and milestones. For example, [open.cdc.gov's releases each time a new version is published to the web site](https://github.com/CDCgov/opencdc/releases/tag/v1.0.9) or [geneflow's changelog](https://github.com/CDCgov/geneflow/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). * [ ] Follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) when creating versions for your project. * [ ] Describe and test reproducible practices to install and build your project. For example, [injury_autocoding's code section on running the project's scripts](https://github.com/cdcai/injury_autocoding#code)). * [ ] Recognize contributors and existing resources that have helped the project. For example, [fdns-ms-hl7-utils' AUTHORS file](https://github.com/CDCgov/fdns-ms-hl7-utils/blob/master/AUTHORS). * [ ] Automate build and test procedures to reduce the effort of outside contributors to send pull requests (eg, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/), [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions)) * [ ] [Appropriately gather metrics](https://opensource.guide/metrics/) on how your project is used and incorporate this into your feature planning process. * [ ] [Incorporate documentation into your development cycle](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-open-source-toolkit/blob/master/toolkit_docs/documentation.md), and where possible, automate the generation of documentation so it is more likely to be up to date and useful to people interested in your project. ## Guidance ### Support and Feedback If you need additional support with your setting up project, or have any feedback or ideas about this guidance please [open an issue](https://github.com/CDCgov/template/issues) or send an email to [data@cdc.gov](mailto:data@cdc.gov). We also accept pull requests if you want to directly edit the guidance. ### Non-Compliance Procedure Projects in this organization are reviewed occasionally for compliance with the [Required Practices](#required-practices). If your project is found to not be in compliance, you will be contacted by administrators to help bring your project into compliance. Projects that do not respond or that habitually fail to meet these practices will be archived or removed from the organization, depending on severity. ### Profile Setup Please make sure your profile is set up properly to help us work better together. Specifically, keep your profile up to date with: * **Name:** Your first and last name. * **Company:** Your government agency or contracting company. (If you also use GitHub for personal projects, consider specifying “CDC (work) + personal projects” to make it clear that some of your GitHub projects may be personal in nature.) * **Location:** Your primary work location (city, state). * **Photo:** A headshot photo, or an appropriate image that is unique to you. If you admin any projects, make sure to [secure your account with two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.21/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa). Although you probably already did this because you are smart. ### Open Source Checklist So you've decided to set up an open source project at CDC. Here are the steps to do that, in the most common order. * [ ] Create a new project using the [template repo](https://github.com/CDCgov/template). * [ ] Update your readme.md following the [CDC GitHub Practices for Open Source Projects](https://github.com/CDCgov/template/blob/master/open_practices.md) * [ ] Choose a license. Most projects are ASL2, but license should meet public health program need. See for more info on choosing a license. * [ ] Remove all sensitive info. * [ ] Talk with your ADI, ADS, and ISSO for review and clearance. * [ ] After approval, create a GitHub user. * [ ] Fill out the [Request a Repo form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=aQjnnNtg_USr6NJ2cHf8j44WSiOI6uNOvdWse4I-C2NUNk43NzMwODJTRzA4NFpCUk1RRU83RTFNVi4u) for a new repo on [CDCGov](https://github.com/cdcgov) or [CDCai](https://github.com/cdcai). * [ ] When you get an email or push alert that your repo is ready, push to GitHub * [ ] Add an entry in [open.cdc.gov](https://open.cdc.gov) on their [code page](https://open.cdc.gov/code.html) to officially be linked from cdc.gov. This helps users find and use your project. * [ ] Keep your project up to date, when you're finished flag it as [archived](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/archiving-repositories). _This checklist was adapted from the CDC IT Guard Rail and put here to help people who don't have access to the intranet._ ### CDC Enterprise Our [CDCent](https://github.com/cdcent/) organization is used for private, non-public projects so only CDC staff and approved outside collaborators work on these projects, you can request access through the [GitHub Enterprise Cloud form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=aQjnnNtg_USr6NJ2cHf8j44WSiOI6uNOvdWse4I-C2NUQjVJVDlKS1c0SlhQSUxLNVBaOEZCNUczVS4u). ### Reference Links These are helpful links from across the Federal Government regarding open sourcing code. * [CFPB Open Tech](https://cfpb.github.io/) * [TTS Engineering Practices Guide](https://engineering.18f.gov/) * [18F Open Source Policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy) and [Practicing our open source policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/practice.md) * [GitHub and Government: How agencies build software](https://government.github.com/) * [code.gov](https://code.gov) * [Federal Source Code and Open Source Toolkit](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-open-source-toolkit) * [Federal Source Code Policy (M-16-21)](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/) * [openCDC](https://open.cdc.gov) * [Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) * [CDC/ATSDR Policy on Public Health Research and Nonresearch Data Management and Access](https://www.cdc.gov/maso/policy/policy385.pdf) * [CDC/ATSDR Policy on Releasing and Sharing Data](https://www.cdc.gov/maso/Policy/ReleasingData.pdf) (old version, but still a useful reference) * [Clearance of Information Products Disseminated Outside CDC for Public Use](https://www.cdc.gov/os/policies/docs/CDC-GA-2005-06_Clearance_of_Information_Products_Disseminated_Outside_for_Public_Use.pdf) * [Federal Source Code Toolkit](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-open-source-toolkit)" },{"title": "Rules of Behavior and Posting Guidelines for the Use of GitHub as a Third-Party Web Application", "url": "/rules_of_behavior/", "content": "# Rules of Behavior and Posting Guidelines for the Use of GitHub as a Third-Party Web Application ## Purpose These rules of behavior establish the privacy and information security requirements for the use of Third Party Web Applications (TPWAs) in conjunction with the CDC GitHub.com organizations established for open source projects. These rules of behavior were developed to ensure that CDC and its confidential information and technologies are not compromised, as well as protecting general CDC interests and services from risks associated with the use of TPWAs while allowing for the increased efficiencies and cost savings that come with appropriate use of third party services. ## Scope These rules of behavior and its related guidance apply to federal employees, contractors, and all external collaborators who will access GitHub from CDC directly or use them with non-sensitive data obtained from CDC. All engagement with TPWAs related to the GitHub will be governed by these rules of behavior, as well as to the Rules of Behavior for the Use of HHS Information Services. ## Ownership CDC assigns three stewards in charge of rules and policy compliance: a Business Steward, a Security Steward, and a Technical Steward. The business and security stewards are responsible for establishing policy and providing approval, while the technical steward fulfills requests from users. Users requesting access to GitHub that have not been approved yet need to assign a main and a backup point of contact (POC) with the business steward, as well as provide a justification to the security steward. The security steward is responsible for the security of the GitHub usage as a TPWA and its impact on the CDC network and compliance with CDC security policies. All users, including POCs, are responsible for adherence to this policy and associated processes. Where there is not a rule of behavior that provides explicit guidance, users must do their best to safeguard CDC and its network and services from security risks. ## Rules of Behavior All new users of GitHub must read and acknowledge these rules before using any of the approved TPWAs. This acknowledgment must be completed annually, and establishes agreement from part of the user to adhere to these rules. * I understand that I must complete security awareness and records management training annually in order to comply with the latest security and records management policies. * I understand that I must also follow the Rules of Behavior for use of HHS Information Resources. * I understand that I must not use, share, or store any kind of sensitive data (health status, provision or payment of healthcare, pictures, PII, etc.) with TPWAs under ANY circumstance. * I will not knowingly conceal, falsify or remove information.This includes editing or removing the template language provided when a Github repository is created. * I understand that I can only use non-sensitive and/or publicly available data in GitHub. If you are unsure of what constitutes non-sensitive information, please see guidance below. * I understand that all passwords I create to set up GitHub accounts need to comply with CDC’s password policy. * I understand that the steward reserves the right to moderate all data at any time. * I understand my responsibilities to protect systems and data as specified by CDC policies. ## Guidance Regarding Non-Sensitive and Publicly Available Information In support of program collaboration in the use oF GitHub, portions of some GitHub projects are either currently open to the public or may become open to the public in the future. The following guidelines will inform and assist the user in determining that the information to be posted on GitHub is not sensitive. The bottom line is if the content you are posting is not appropriate to post for public access, it should not be posted on GitHub. Before posting information that involves other CDC programs, employees, etc. to GitHub, it is important that the poster ensures they receive approval by the relevant CDC entity to post the information. Questions to consider before posting information include: | Do I have reservations about anyone viewing this information? | Yes | Do not post. | | Were individuals informed that this information would be posted on GitHub? | No | Do not post. | | Does this information contain details or descriptions of CDC security systems or other sensitive infrastructures? | Yes | Do not post. | | Does this information reflect program efforts to engage and inform external partners and the public? | No | Do not post. | Examples of information which has been deemed not sensitive and may be posted on GitHub include the following. * Source Code * Use cases * User stories/requirements * Process flows * Program pain points * Software Service Descriptions Sensitive information, which should not be posted, includes (but is not limited to) the following. * Information directly attributed to an individual in a sensitive manner * The names or pictures of individuals * Protected health information * Project management material. This includes posting or discussing security documentation, implementation plans, communications regarding project specifics, etc. * Opinions related to programs or tools, specifically those that may have an adverse impact * Non-public Links to CDC SharePoint or other internal references * Non-public Details on CDC internal infrastructure If there’s any question on whether information may be sensitive (such as detailed interview notes or specific references provided during a program interview), further guidance should be sought from the security steward prior to posting the information on any GitHub. ## Enforcement Users looking to use GitHub that are unable to follow these rules of behavior will not have authorization to do so. Any users that violate these rules of behavior or CDC security policies may be subject to action, up to and including revoking access to GitHub. Technical and security stewards have the right to enforce these rules of behavior based on violations at any time. ## References * [Policy for Managing the Use of Third-Party Websites and Applications](https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/asa/ocio/cybersecurity/policy-social-media-technologies/index.html) * [Rules of Behavior for Use of HHS Information Resources](http://www.hhs.gov/ocio/policy/hhs-rob.html) * [Security and Awareness Training](http://sat.cdc.gov/) (requires login)" }];
